Here's how the app works:

   * There will be four Boba Fetts displayed as buttons on the page.

   * The player will be shown a random number at the start of the game.

   * When the player clicks on a Boba Fett, it will add a specific amount of points to the player's total score. 

     * The game hides this amount until the player clicks a Boba.
     * When they do click one, the player's score counter updates.

   * The player wins if their total score matches the random number from the beginning of the game.

   * The player loses if their score goes above the random number.

   * The game should restart whenever the player wins or loses. It doesn't now, but it is being worked on.

     * When the game begins again, the player should see a new random number. Also, all the crystals will have four new hidden values. Of course, the user's score (and score counter) will reset to zero.

   * The app shows the number of games the player wins and loses.
